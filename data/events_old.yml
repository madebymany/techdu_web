  date: "27th February 2015"
  description: "On 27th February, tEchDU will deliver a guest workshop to teachers in training at the London South Bank University. We have been kindly invited by Clare Copeland, who is a senior lecturer in Education and a Course Director for PGCE Primary & Early Years teachers, to talk to her class about technology in education.
We’re beyond excited to share some of our knowledge but mainly to learn what young teachers to be are looking for in technology and how tech can make their careers in teaching better. Stay tuned for the post-workshop insights and documentation."

  title: "Kids"
  venue: "Made By Many"
  date: "5th Apr 2014"
  description: "On April 5 at Made by Many offices, we hosted our first event tEchDU.Kids: Learn with Technology. It was an exciting fun opportunity to play with technology that got kids and parents learning together. See how it went in the video. 
  Having such great support from Technology Will Save Us and Codasign, who organised the two workshops, we unlocked the curiosity even in the shiest children and transformed it into a desire to know how things work and learn with technology.
  During the workshops, we got kids painting images with conductive paint, which then turned the images into magical circuits and brought light and sound to their paintings, and thanks to DYI Gamer Kits using arduino children learned how to program games.
  It was a great experiment and a learning opportunity for us too, to see not only children being excited about technology, but also all the parents encouraging their kids and getting directly involved.
  We were absolutely delighted to see the amount of interest this triggered, and to receive such positive feedback at the event and afterwards. With tickets being sold out in a couple of days and a 100% turnout we are sure that this was a successful start of the tEchDU project.
  Thanks to everyone for taking part and see you soon in the next adventure!"
